## Sentiment Analysis 
#### *Project created as part of GWU Data Analytics course.*
> Twitter API, Tweepy, VADER, Python

* Sentiment analysis conducted on Twitter accounts using VADER.

## Instructions

To implement Plotbot in your twitter account just substitute the example account used in the Jupyter Notebook with your own account and import your Twitter API key information.

Please consider that VADER only applies proper sentiment analysis in English language. Therefore, tweets in a different language will not get an appropriate result and sentiment analysis will not be trustworthy for those accounts.
